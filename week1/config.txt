CRLF stands for "Carriage Return Line Feed," which are special characters used to denote the end of a line of text in a file.
  Different operating systems use different characters to represent the end of a line:

Windows uses CRLF (\r\n).
Unix/Linux uses LF (\n).

Git provides several options to help manage line endings:

Core Autocrlf:
This setting automatically converts line endings to the appropriate style based on your operating system.
To enable it, you can set the core.autocrlf configuration option:

# On Windows:
         git config --global core.autocrlf true
# This converts LF to CRLF on checkout and CRLF to LF on commit.

# On Unix/Linux/macOS:
         git config --global core.autocrlf input
# This converts CRLF to LF on commit but leaves LF unchanged on checkout.

To explicitly set line endings, you can use the core.eol configuration option:

       git config --global core.eol lf  # Use LF for line endings
     git config --global core.eol crlf  # Use CRLF for line endings


pen the Credential Manager:
Press Win + R, type control.exe keymgr.dll, and press Enter.
Or search for "Credential Manager" in the Windows Start Menu.
Go to the "Windows Credentials" tab.
Look for entries related to git or github.com.
Remove these entries by clicking on them and selecting "Remove".

  macOS:

Open Keychain Access:
You can find this in Applications > Utilities > Keychain Access, or use Spotlight Search.
Search for entries related to git or github.com.
Delete these entries.
Linux:

If you have used a credential helper like libsecret, you might need to clear stored credentials:
sh
Copy code
printf "protocol=https\nhost=github.com\n" | git credential-cache erase
2. Clear Credentials in VS Code Settings
VS Code may also store Git credentials in its settings. To ensure these are cleared:

Open VS Code.
Go to File > Preferences > Settings (or use Ctrl + ,).
In the search bar, type "Git".
Look for settings related to authentication, like "Git: Credential Manager".
Reset or remove any credentials or authentication settings.
3. Clear the Git Credential Cache
If you've used Git's credential cache, clear it with the following command:

git credential-cache exit
Or, if you've used the credential store:


git credential-store --file ~/.git-credentials remove
rm ~/.git-credentials
4. Remove Git Configuration Entries
Remove any credentials stored in your Git configuration:


git config --global --unset credential.helper
git config --system --unset credential.helper
5. Restart VS Code
