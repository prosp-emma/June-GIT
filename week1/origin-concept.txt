In Git, origin is not an entity that exists on GitHub itself.
Instead, it is an alias or shorthand name that exists locally in your Git configuration to refer to the remote repository from which you cloned your project or 
                     the main remote repository you interact with.

When you clone a repository from GitHub, Git automatically sets up a remote named origin that points to the URL of the repository you cloned.
This alias makes it easier to refer to that repository in your Git commands.

The origin alias is stored in your local Git configuration (typically in the .git/config file within your repository).
Convenient Shorthand:

Instead of typing the full URL of your remote repository every time you want to fetch, pull, or push changes, you use origin as a shorthand.
Example:
When you run:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Git automatically creates an alias named origin pointing to https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git. You can see this by running:

Add a Remote:
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
This manually adds a remote named origin.

Change a Remote URL:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/your-username/new-repo.git

Remove a Remote:
git remote remove origin

origin is a local alias used to refer to the main remote repository you are working with. 
It doesn't exist (Physically ) as an entity on GitHub itself, but it points to the repository URL on GitHub.
This alias is part of your local Git configuration and is a convenient way to manage and refer to your remote repositories.

origin location in local repo, cd .git/ then cat config , show all remote repo aliases
